# Convolutional Neural Network to Identify Cats and Dogs

### What is this?
This is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow. The purpose of the network is to classifiy pictures of dogs vs pictures of cats. The network has 6 convolution layers with two fully connected layers. The accuracy is 
around 80%.

### Libraries needed to run the code?

* You need to download the testing and training data from my google docs on:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8fg-YhyrhX_LCFFhAw6GQkrjqWoWRBm?usp=sharing
* Tensorflow
* numpy
* cv2
* matplotlib
* tflearn

### Other

* You need to tweak the code and change the macros to your desigred paths and
name the cnn model file how you want.
