# Deep-Learning-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

## What is this?
This is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow. The purpose of the network is to classifiy pictures of dogs vs pictures of cats. The network has 6 convolution layers with two fully connected layers. The accuracy is 
around 80%.

## What do I need to run this?

* You need to download the testing and training data from my google docs on:
